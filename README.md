# blender-constraints-for-unity
Adds a number of custom components () that mimic some of Blender's object & bone constraints, or limited versions therof.

WARNING: this was an ad-hoc solution for a personal project. Functionality is very limited to my specific use cases and not rigidly tested. Code is presented as-is without guarantees etc.
